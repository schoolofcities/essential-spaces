CPG-0000000530,Hospice Georgina,Hospice Georgina,"Poverty, social isolation, living alone, compromised health issues, limited family connections or support in  the community has negatively impacted individuals, specifically seniors in our area. Through research we  know there is a correlation between Mental Health and Well-being and social connections and access to  services. Our services will Reach beyond the limitations of poverty, and social isolation and connect  individuals with a variety of needs, and seniors 60+ to services that address healthy aging, encourage individuals to live a quality life, will be addressed through group and peer experiences, and will provide equal opportunity and equal access, at no cost to clients.    Seniors Age 60+  Individuals with Low Income, and/or living in poverty  Limited access to transportation  Caregivers  Women and girls  Youth  2SLGBTQ  Racialized  Physical, Mental or Emotional Disabilities  Indigenous  Socially isolated    Addressing Needs & Gaps:  Improving the Mental Health and Quality of Life of Seniors age 60 + and marginalized individuals who  are experiencing the impact of COVID, social isolation, and have limited access to support.  We will do this by offering in home supports, peer and intergenerational connections, access to individual  and group programming on a weekly basis.  2. Providing weekly programming and supports for Caregivers such as ""Caregiver Cafe"" while at the  same time offering supports to their person they care for e.g. ""Caregiver Friend"" so they can attend  programs that focus on and improve the quality of their life as caregivers. Long term care facilities have  been successful in using university students in an innovative program called ""Adopt a Grandparent"".  Caregiver friends will operate in much the same way.  3. We will employ a Mental Health and Well Being Coordinator who will facilitate programs specifically  designed to meet the care plans designed by the individual and Coordinator thus improving the quality of  life of individuals with a focus on their physical and psychosocial well being. Referrals will come through  our staff and local clinics, agencies, nurse practitioners, spiritual leaders, school counsellors and by  individuals themselves.  4. We serve a population of individuals with chronic needs or a life limiting illness, who are grieving,  vulnerable, need to access help for appointments and transportation. We are increasingly aware of those  who take advantage of these individuals and often find themselves in situations of elder abuse. It is our  goal to employ a Mental Health & Wellness Coach/Coordinator who will facilitate individual conversations,  community presentations and workshops to increase awareness and provide options for safer living.  5. Facilitate relationships with the Indigenous population of Georgina Island and Georgina. Provide  culturally diverse programming to meet client needs. Raise awareness and perspectives.      12. State the program/initiative’s objectives.  Hire a Mental Health & Wellness Coordinator with an Indigenous Background and/or who has experience  in the area outlined in this proposal, and with the populations mentioned  Mental Health & Wellness Coordinator to work 32 hours each week facilitating individual and group sessions and motivate peers or intergenerational connections for clients.  12 to 18 individual sessions, in home and/or in-person weekly x 1 hour = 12 hours  Offer 4 Mental Health and Wellness groups weekly.  One weekly group, Facilitating a Caregiver Cafe program x 2 hours weekly.  Facilitating arrangements to provide respite for caregivers through the Caregiver Cafe offering Mental  Health & Wellness Programs and  Facilitating ""Caregiver Friends"" who will spend time with their loved one while the caregiver is attending  their program. = 2 hours / weekly  Annually providing a Caregiver half day Cafe with a variety of wellness opportunities, holistic modalities  to choose from.  2. Two (2) Weekly Wellness Programs x 2 hours each to Individuals and 60+ providing a  psychosocial/spiritual approach to wellness = 4 hours/weekly  3. Celebrating Cultural diversity, weekly. Information and Engaging sessions on a variety of topics e.g.  2SLGBTQ, Indigenous Storytelling, Drumming, Celebrations. 1 x 2 hours = 2 hours weekly  Educational Programs:  Community Program called: ""Raising awareness: Pushing beyond Limitations""  Engage the community with Lunch & Learn sessions on a variety of topics, for example: Elder Abuse,  Internet Safety, Poverty, Signs of Dementia.  2 groups x 1 hour each or 1 group x 2 hours = 2 hours weekly  Offering a psychosocial approach to wellness by engaging clients in holistic modalities such as Reiki,  Singing Bowls, Drumming, Medicine Wheel. Facilitated by our new hire or by arranging for practitioners to  offer services weekly x 6 hours. = 6 hrs  Administrative Time: program attendance, case notes, planning, clients surveys, preparation            How will we provide proven or good practices so that we know they will have a positive impact on our clients:  We have partnered with organizations to facilitate a weekly Coffee and Chat group and have found that  weekly programs are more effective than bi weekly or monthly programs. Clients know the programs run  consistently on the same day, same time, each week and attendance is consistent with this approach.    We will facilitate programs in the daytime, evening and weekends to accommodate for clients that work  shifts, or work either daytime or evening. The flexibility in scheduling allows for more participation. This  flexibility of scheduling has proven effective with our current programs.    We know from our past track record that caregivers cannot attend sessions for their own wellness if  someone is not available to support their loved one. We also know that caregivers are exhausted and if  they are going to take time away from caregiving, the program needs to be uplifting, engaging and/or  informative. Death cafe's started in Europe and have taken place all across Canada. Our idea to host a  Caregiver Cafe comes from this concept with the goal of providing Caregivers opportunities to voice their  ideas, concerns, suggestions while engaging in meaningful, uplifting experiences.    To build our connection with residents of Georgina Island and the indigenous population in our region, we  need to build relationships and connections. Our intent to hire someone who is Indigenous, or has a  positive relationship with the Indigenous community makes sense. To learn, grow and understand we  need to have someone with lived experience.    We provide transportation, where possible, for our clients to attend our programs. We offer flexibility in  scheduling, and our goal is to offer supports from youth to Seniors 60+.  How have we modified our programs over the pandemic and what challenges have we faced?  Over the past 18 months our programs pivoted from in-person to virtual or telephone, and then a  combination of both in-person and virtual and telephone. We purchased tablets to connect individuals  through technology. 50% of our grief and caregiver clients did not have the knowledge to use technology  and chose to put services on hold or have telephone check-ins only, Initially, because they didn't think  the pandemic would last as long as it has lasted. Another challenge was the social isolation clients  experienced, the inability of our staff to engage in-person with clients, provide transportation or visits  due to lockdown or limited contact outside of family circles. Staff changes during the pandemic was  another challenge with a change in staffing needs to meet client needs. Our programming for youth  became limited, recognizing that younger children need to engage in-person, while many youth were  comfortable with technology, the in-person connection was the missing link.  Caregivers have been isolated from their loved ones who are living in long term care facilities, and those that  have loved ones at home, felt intense pressure, had limited to no options for support due to isolation and  lockdowns. Any modalities that once were in place are no longer due to the nature of the modality e.g.  Reiki, Reflexology are modalities where individuals are in close contact. These services while highly  needed at this time were out of service due to COVID restrictions.    How will the program initiative enhance and/or be expanded?  We have not had Caregiver Cafe's or an annual Caregiver Day where caregivers can engage in uplifting  programs to care for their own Mental Health & Wellness needs. This would be a new program. Adding to  this a component that cares for the individual by providing a Caregiver friend who supports the individual  during the caregiver time away.  New to our organization: Hiring a trained Mental Health & Wellness Coordinator, with experience with  marginalized populations, an Indigenous background and/or experience in this area, and one who is  qualified to provide individual sessions, and facilitate groups for all ages, would be a wonderful addition  and even more important reach more people in need in our community.  Through individual sessions with clients we have realized individuals are struggling with the death of  children and young adults from substance use, and the individuals we are serving are consoling their own  needs with substance use. Providing programs aimed at Mental Health and Wellness, workshops and  weekly programs will raise awareness of the issues and provide healthy strategies for coping with loss ",Aging in Community,Yes,Program,Hybrid (combination of in-person and virtual),20849 Dalton Rd,Unit C,Sutton West,L0E 1R0,356,,"In-home service,Informal community spaces (e.g., local coffee shop)",No,
